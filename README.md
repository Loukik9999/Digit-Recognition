# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system can detect and recognize faces from images or video streams, making it useful for various applications such as security authentication, attendance tracking, and user verification.

## Features
- Detects faces in images and video streams.
- Recognizes known faces based on a trained model.
- Can be integrated with real-time video feed.
- Uses machine learning techniques for accurate recognition.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Face Recognition Library (dlib)
- Jupyter Notebook


## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Face Recognition (1).ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.
3. To test the model, provide images or video input for face detection and recognition.

## Dataset
- The project requires a dataset of known faces for training.
- Ensure that images are labeled correctly before training the model.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance model accuracy with deep learning techniques.
- Implement live video feed recognition.
- Optimize performance for faster face detection.
